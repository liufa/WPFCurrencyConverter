# converter-matas
Develop a small currency converter WPF application. Data should be received from public APIs. Users can change/add/delete currencies and conversion should happen on user's input. The application should keep settings when closed.

Reference API list: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#currency-exchange

Assume that application is a prototype and a lot of features might be added later. Please add an imaginary todo list of what could be changed or added in the future.

Feel free to choose a framework, but let us know the reasoning. Further architecture and code decisions are all up to you. Just present your skills and what you find is necessary when developing an application.
